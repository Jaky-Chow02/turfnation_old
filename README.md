## Database Schema

### User Model
Stores user credentials, profile information, role designation, and activity statistics.

### Turf Model
Contains turf details including location, available sports, pricing, operating hours, and current condition status.

### Booking Model
Records booking information with user and turf references, time slots, payment details, QR codes, and weather data.

### Tournament Model
Manages tournament data including participants, match schedules, rules, and status tracking.

### Weather Model
Caches weather information for locations with temperature, conditions, and suitability assessments.

### Rewards Model
Tracks user points, achievement levels, earned badges, milestones, and leaderboard rankings.

## Development Workflow

The project follows an agile development approach with four main sprints:

1. Backend infrastructure and database models
2. Authentication and turf management APIs
3. Booking system with QR code generation
4. Tournament and rewards modules with weather integration

## Testing

API endpoints can be tested using:
- Postman for comprehensive API testing
- Thunder Client VS Code extension
- cURL commands for quick tests

Example test request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

## Known Limitations

- Payment processing currently uses mock transactions
- Email notification system is not yet implemented
- Frontend user interface is under development

## Future Scope

- Integration with real payment gateways
- Email and SMS notification services
- Advanced analytics dashboard for administrators
- Mobile application development
- Social networking features for players
- Live match scoring capabilities
- Equipment rental management
